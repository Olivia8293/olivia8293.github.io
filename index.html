<font size=4> Fun website &copy; </font> <br> <i> Pink, Lavender &amp; Plum </i>
<p> This is my fun website, I am Gertrude, I am 80 years old, and I enjoy staying active by hiking and rowing. I have recently become interested in computers after learning more about how I can record my own weaving and knitting patterns using Excel. I think computers provide a wealth of new information and in the latter years of my life, I would like to learn a new skill to connect with my younger relatives such as my great-nieces.</p>
<p>My favorite colors are light pinks and purples, as you can see from the page. I enjoy weaving small blankets for my friend's many grandchildren, and I use light pastel colors.</p>
<p>In my younger days I was a park ranger in one of Canada's beautiful national parks, Banff. I am well-versed in map reading, rescue procedures, and how to correctly interact with wildlife. In my older years, I still try to participate in environmental activism. </p> 
I highly recommend you learn more about Canada's national parks, such as my favorite 
<a HREF="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff">Banff</a> and other wonderful parks such as <a HREF="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ns/cbreton">Cape Breton Highlands</a>

<p>Gardening is a hobby of mine as well. I've provided a list of my favorite flowers and when I plant them at the end of the page. The images below are not my garden, though I do find them very nice!</p>
